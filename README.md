# PyTorch Neural Network Visualization with Raylib

## Overview:

This project demonstrates the integration of PyTorch for running a neural network and Raylib for real-time visualization. The neural network is trained using PyTorch, and the trained model's predictions are visualized using the Raylib library.

## Requirements:

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Raylib
- NumPy

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install torch raylib numpy
```

## Usage:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Observe the Raylib window displaying the neural network's predictions in real-time.

## File Structure:

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the PyTorch neural network and uses Raylib for visualization.
- `model.py`: Contains the PyTorch neural network model definition.
- `data.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `visualization.py`: Manages the visualization using Raylib.
